# Turtle_race
The program is a turtle race betting game. The user is prompted to enter a color to bet on which turtle will win the race. The turtles are then created with the specified colors, and they race from left to right on the screen. The program uses a while loop to check if any turtle has crossed the finish line yet. Once a turtle has won, the program determines if the user's bet was correct and prints out the result. Finally, the program exits when the user clicks on the screen.
